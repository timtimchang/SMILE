# SMILE: SEQUENCE-TO-SEQUENCE DOMAIN ADAPTATION WITH MINIMIZING LATENT ENTROPY FOR TEXT IMAGE RECOGNITION

## Overview
The proposed SMILE (Sequence-to-sequence domain adaption with MInimizing Latent Entropy) is a UDA (unsupervised domain adaption) method with minimizing latent entropy on sequence-to-sequence attention-based models with class-balanced self-paced learning.
